"# SpringCloudConfigVsSpringBoot" 

One thing to note is that Spring Boot is released independently of the Spring Cloud release train. Therefore, different versions of Spring
Boot are incompatible with different releases of Spring Cloud. You can see the version dependences between
Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, along with the different subproject versions contained within the release train, by referring to the Spring
Cloud website (http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/).
